# IDC Classifier CaffeNet

![IDC Classifier](../../images/IDC-Classification.jpg)

## Introduction

**IDC Classifier CaffeNet** uses **Caffe** (**CaffeNet**) to provide a way to train a neural network with labelled **breast cancer histology images** to detect **Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC)** in unseen/unlabelled images.

For training a custom trained **CaffeNet model** for detecting **Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC)** trained on the **Intel AI DevCloud** is used and for classification the project uses the **Intel® Movidius**.

# DISCLAIMER

The purpose of the tutorial and source code for **IDC Classifier** is to help people learn how to create computer vision projects and for people interested in the medical use case evaluate if it may help them and to expand upon. Although the the program is fairly accurate in testing, this project is not meant to be an alternative for use instead of seeking professional help. I am a developer not a doctor or expert on cancer.
